# website1-repo: Code Refactor

In this home work assignment we where supposed to take an existing html file and css style sheet and refactor it. To refactor an existing file simply means to clean up existing code to make it more consolidated and easier to read.

## What the new site looks like

(Preview screenshot)

## How to get to the new website

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## New vs old
