# website1-repo: Code Refactor

In this home work assignment we where supposed to take an existing html file and css style sheet and refactor it. To refactor an existing file simply means to clean up existing code to make it more consolidated and easier to read.

## New vs old

The old website looked fine but the code was broken and confusing. The New website has better functioning code that is easier to read and more condensed.
